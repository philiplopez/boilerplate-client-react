Overview
========

This repository provides a basic setup for modern web client application
development using the React library and JavaScript (ES6) using the following tools:

* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) - for dependency management and basic scripts

* [babel](http://babeljs.io/) - for ES6/JSX transpiling (to ES5)

* [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) - for build tasks (e.g. transpiling)
  and including the [webpack-dev-server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)
  as well as webpack loaders as needed (TODO: babel, LESS, eslint?) 
 
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/) - for JavaScript (ES6 + JSX) 

* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)

* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test framework

* [WebStorm setup tips](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) IDE setup tips
  including [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
  
* Basic responsive client example using:
    * [html5-boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
    * [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) CSS/components for React
